# Aves
This is my Final Year project AVES: Know Your Birds.

It is a GUI application that can detect the species of birds using it's image.

We have used transfer learning in our project and the model is uploaded on the API on Heroku. The input image from the user is sent to API for prediction. 

The output from this Classifier API is used for fetching the details of the birds from another API which only contains the details of the all the Birds on the same platform Heroku made by us.

Some of the Screen Shots from the our Applicaion are provided:
